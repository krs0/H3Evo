### VCMI based expansion for Heroes of Might and Magic 3

Scope of the project is to make an even better and rich in content Heroes III, based on VCMI engine, starting from the good ideas already present in HotA, WoG Third Upgrades Mod or others.
As a general rule, the scope of the expansion is to improve on existing style and not to introduce radical changes. That beeing said there are no hard rules to obey like: never modify a creature's stats.

The expansion will be built from self contained mods. Each individual change, will be a standalone, independent mod, that can be reused either by itself, or as a submod within other projects.
Where possible, existing mods will be reused.

The release will be done incrementally. Once a submod is ready and can be integrated with the rest, it will be added to the expansion.

Suggestions and help is more than welcome. There is a huge list of thigs to be done. If you do not have or do not want to maintain your own repository, it can be hosted in this repository with public access.

These starting ideas are mine or were gathered over the years from various sources. The main source of inspiration is player posts on: http://heroescommunity.com/forumdisplay.php3?FID=12

### Current status
First version already up and running. It already makes use of the bigger mods:
- HotA 99%:
-   -  Warehouses made more random: (now they behave more like windmills). In HotA they are mines basicaly, that you had to visit each week
    -  Small prison template removed, because it does not fit aesteticaly with the rest of objects
- From WoG: Using only Neutral creatures, H3 Data patches, map decorations and WoG graphic fixes mod
-   -  Disabled some objects: Kept only 1 Treasure Chest template, disabled small prison, disabled shrineOfMagicLevel3
    -  Disabled werewolves because they exist in ToW mod
- From Tides of War: Using only third upgrades and neutrals
- Plague tent added to Necropolis instead of the first Aid tent. It casts only plague (unlike Andruids version that casts poison as well). Hero Bubonic with specialty Plague Tent
- New artifact Cursed Lamp found on lava, gives Efreet
- New artifact Mirage Lamp found on sand, gives Efreet of Geenies
