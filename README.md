### VCMI based expansion for Heroes of Might and Magic 3

Scope of the project is to make an even better and rich in content Heroes III, based on VCMI engine, starting from the good ideas already present in HotA, WoG, Alternative Upgrades Mod or others.
As a general rule, the scope of the expansion is to improve on existing style and not to introduce radical changes.

The expansion will be built from self contained mods. Each individual change, will be a standalone, independent mod, that can be reused either by itself, or as a submod within other projects.
Where possible, existing mods will be reused.

The release will be done incrementally. Once a submod is ready and can be integrated with the rest, it will be added to the expansion.

Suggestions and help is more than welcome. There is a huge list of thigs to be done. See the Projects section for a full list of changes taken into consideration.

These starting ideas are mine or were gathered over the years from various sources. The main source of inspiration is player posts on: [heroescommunity.com forums](http://heroescommunity.com/forumdisplay.php3?FID=12)

### Current status

and last but not least  
Helping VCMI get closer to end product
