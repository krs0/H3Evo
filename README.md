### VCMI based expansion for Heroes of Might and Magic 3

Scope of the project is to make an even better Heroes III, based on VCMI engine, starting from the good ideas already present in HotA.
As a general rule, the scope of the expansion is to improve on existing style and not to introduce radical changes. That beeing said there are no hard rules to obey like: never modify a creature's stats.

The expansion will be built from self contained mods. Each individual change, will be a standalone, independent mod, that can be reused either by itself, or as a submod within other projects.
Where possible, existing mods will be reused.

Anyone can suggest or implement any of the mods. Any contribution is more than welcome. If you do not have or do not want to maintain your own repository, it can be hosted in this repository with public access.

These starting ideas are mine or were gathered over the years from various sources. The main source of inspiration is player posts on: http://heroescommunity.com/forumdisplay.php3?FID=12

### Current status
> Continuously consolidating all the seemingly separate ideas, into a cohesive expansion  
> Implementing some of the no-brainers. (Things that will be in without a doubt and some of the low-hanging fruits)  
> Refining the skills and spells  
> Looking for collaborators  
and last but not least  
Help VCMI get closer to end product
